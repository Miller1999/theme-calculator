## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've been tinkering with TypeScript for a few months now, but I haven't really had the chance to dive deep into it. Now, for this project, I'm determined to really get the hang of it and use it like a pro! But i don't use interfaces

### Continued development

I want to work more with TypeScript
